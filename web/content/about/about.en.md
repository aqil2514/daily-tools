# About Flowtooly

Flowtooly is a free online tools platform designed to help developers, students, and professionals handle everyday tasks quickly and efficiently.

Flowtooly was created to address the need for simple, accessible tools that can be used instantly without complicated processes. Many online tools today feel heavy, filled with ads, or require users to sign up before getting started — Flowtooly offers a more practical alternative.

Our goal is simple: to provide practical, easy-to-use utility tools that run directly in your browser without installation or registration.

## What You Can Do with Flowtooly

Flowtooly offers a growing collection of online tools, including:

- Calculators for financial and mathematical needs
- Developer tools such as formatters and converters
- Image and PDF utilities
- Text and data processing tools

All tools are designed to be lightweight, fast, and accessible across devices, including desktop and mobile.

## Privacy-Focused by Design

We respect your privacy. Most tools on Flowtooly run entirely in your browser, meaning your data is not uploaded or stored on our servers unless explicitly stated.

You can use Flowtooly with confidence, without worrying about unnecessary data collection or storage.

## Our Vision

Flowtooly aims to become a reliable and free hub for utility tools — whether for work, study, or everyday use.

We continuously improve existing tools and add new ones based on real-world user needs, while gradually enhancing overall quality and usability.
